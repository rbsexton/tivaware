# Custom West Manifest for Projects Using Out-of-Tree TivaWare
#
# This manifest imports the standard Zephyr manifest and adds
# TivaWare as a local out-of-tree module.
#
# To use this:
# 1. Create a new west workspace directory
# 2. Place this file as west.yml in your application directory
# 3. Run: west init -l <your-app-dir>
# 4. Run: west update

manifest:
  # Use self to indicate this repository is the manifest repository
  self:
    path: .

  remotes:
    - name: zephyrproject
      url-base: https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos

  # Import the standard Zephyr manifest
  projects:
    - name: zephyr
      remote: zephyrproject
      revision: main
      # Or specify a specific version:
      # revision: v3.7.0
      import: true

    # Add TivaWare as a local project
    - name: tivaware
      path: ../projects/tivaware
      # For local projects, no remote/revision needed
      # West will just reference the local directory

  # Alternatively, if TivaWare were in a git repository:
  # projects:
  #   - name: tivaware
  #     url: https://github.com/your-org/tivaware.git
  #     revision: main
  #     path: modules/hal/tivaware
